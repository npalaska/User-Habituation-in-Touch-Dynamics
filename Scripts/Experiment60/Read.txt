This script will simply append the genuine train and test files from experiment 4 with imposture train and test files respectively from experiment 5.
So now we have the complete train and test data consisting of genuine and imposture data to use for the classifier.
From experiment 5 we know that we have 10 Imposture Train and Test files from every user and from experiment 4 we know that we have 3 blocks of genuine train and test data.
In total we will get 30 test and 30 train files for every user based on distinct combination of block and fold.
The naming convention is 'device-user-posture-train/test-block-fold'.
the files will be saved under Output Files/Experiment6/GIUserNumber.
Every User will have its separate folder containing its complete train and test files (consisting of half genuine and half imposture data)
