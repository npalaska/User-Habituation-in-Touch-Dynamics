Constants: Device 1, Posture 1.
The Script will generate the Mahalanobis distance between the means of successive groups of 5 strokes for every user. For calculating the M-Distance we are only considering the first 4 features.
It will generate the matrix of 31 columns (users) and ((total length of row data)/5) no of rows where each value in every column represent the mahalanobis distance between the means of successive group of strokes stating from top to bottom.
The generated file will be under Output Files/Experiment1.
