This script will generate the imposture data that we need to join with the Genuine data from experiment 4.
As we know that the genuine data from experiment 4 has been divided into 3 equal blocks and each block is been divided into 2 parts as Train and Test data.
For the classifier, The training data must contain the data from genuine and imposture, we decided that the whole training data should contain half genuine and half imposture.
For a good classifier the whole training data must have the imposture data from each other user along with genuine data.
So we decided to take the equal number of imposture strokes from each other user.
So for every user we will have imposture strokes from 30 different users.
we will generate 10 different files(10 folds) of randomly selected imposture strokes for each user and then divide each file in 2 equal parts to get imposture training and testing data.
