Constants: Device 1, Posture 1.
The Script will generate the Mahalanobis distance between the Variance of group of 5 strokes and origin (reference Vector) for every user. For calculating the M-Distance we are only considering the first 4 features.
It will generate the matrix of 31 columns (users) and ((total length of row data)/5) no of rows where each value in every column represent the mahalanobis distance from the variance of group of strokes to origin stating from top to bottom.
The generated file will be under Output Files/Experiment1.
